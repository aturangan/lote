This folder is roughly mirroring the src directory of https://github.com/techacolyte42/google-maps-react which in turn tracks https://github.com/fullstackreact/google-maps-react. The published google-maps-react package is 90% of what we want, but isn't updating frequently enough. I've forked it in case I make any changes that could be pull requested. However, we also may want to make some project specific adjustments (such as loading the map object into redux), so it seems worth having everything here as well.
